I've made several major improvements to your app:

### 1. Added Model Management Features

- Custom models are saved in localStorage and can be organized by category
- Delete button for removing custom models

### 2. Completely Revamped Theme System
- Added 5 theme options with color buttons: Dark, Light, Green, Blue, Purple
- Proper theme saving and application with visual indicators
- All elements properly update with theme changes
- Border highlights on the active theme selection

### 3. Improved UI 
- Better organized settings panel with section grouping
- Fixed all panel toggle bugs
- Added clear notifications for user actions
- Improved dialog design for model management

### 4. Enhanced Functionality
- Natural language model management ("add model" command)
- Added display name support for custom models
- Better organization of models by provider

You can now:
1. Type "add model" in the chat to open the model addition dialog
2. Type "delete model [name]" to remove a model from your list
3. Change themes using the color buttons at the top of settings
4. Organize models into categories when adding them

These changes should give you a much more pleasant and functional experience!
